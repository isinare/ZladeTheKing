I am Ishan Sinare, and This is my personal Repository on my hobbies and projects
Currently I have learnt the python language,
and at the time of writing this am learning java to increase my understanding of general code
I also have some experience with linux, having used multiple distros such as debian, pop os, arch linux, rasbian, manjaro and kali linux, to name a few
I am a networking enthusiast as well, and I happen to have interest in the raspberry pi SBC(single board computer)
